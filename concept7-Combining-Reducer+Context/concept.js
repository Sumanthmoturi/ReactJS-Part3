/*1.Scaling up with Reducer and Context:-
                                          1.Reducers let you consolidate a componentâ€™s state update logic. 
                                          2.Context lets you pass information deep down to other components. 
                                          3.You can combine reducers and context together to manage state of a complex screen.

/*Combining a reducer with context:-
                                    1.Create the context.
                                    2.Put state and dispatch into context.
                                    3.Use context anywhere in the tree.
