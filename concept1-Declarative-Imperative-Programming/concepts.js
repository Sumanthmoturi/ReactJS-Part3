/*Reacting to input with state:-
                                  1.React provides a declarative way to manipulate the UI. 
                                  2.Instead of manipulating individual pieces of the UI directly,you describe the different states that your component can be in, and switch between them in response to the user input
                                  
/*1.Imperative Programming:-
                            1.In imperative UI programming, built without React.It only uses the browser DOM:

/*2.Declarative Programming:-
                            1.Declarative programming means describing the UI for each visual state rather than micromanaging the UI (imperative).
                            2.It is used in frame works like React.

/*3.Thinking about UI declaratively:-When developing a component:
    1.Identify all its visual states.
    2.Determine the human and computer triggers for state changes.
    3.Model the state with useState.
    4.Remove non-essential state to avoid bugs and paradoxes.
    5.Connect the event handlers to set state.
