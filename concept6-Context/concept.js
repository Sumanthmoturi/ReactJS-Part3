/*1.Context:-
              1.We pass information from a parent component to a child component via props. 
              2.But passing props can become verbose and inconvenient if you have to pass them through many components in the middle, or if many components in your app need the same information.
*/


/*2.Alternative way to pass props-Context:-
                                              1.Context lets a parent component provide data to the entire tree below it
                                              2.you will do it in three steps:
                                                                              ->Create a contecxt
                                                                              ->Use the context-
                                                                              ->Provide that context
*/


//Before you use context, try passing props or passing JSX as children.
